# Welcome to the FTL code library
It is something like a cheat sheet for both beginners and experienced developers. It's always nice to have a reference implementation as a starting example without having to keep past projects to see how you did it before and now forget. You can copy part of the code, or the entire code, modify it for your needs and start using it. Or just give an example to a person who needs your help in a task and share your experience.

Don't hesitate to share your best approaches. Ask [Oksana](https://github.com/nayacirdan), [Nazar](https://github.com/NazariiMed), [Yuriy](https://github.com/yuchiko), [Vlad](https://github.com/RuchkoVlad), [Vitalii](https://github.com/Vitaliy-Maznyi) or [Yarik](https://github.com/ykonovets) if you want to push your changes.
